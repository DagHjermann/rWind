\usage{
wind2raster(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an "rWind list" obtained by wind.fit}
}
\value{
A raster stack or a list of raster stacks representing wind direction
and speed.
}
\description{
wind2raster crates a raster stack (gridded) with 2 layers: wind speed and
wind direction from the output of wind.dl function from "rWind" package.
Latitude and logitude values are used to locate raster file and to create
raster using rasterFromXYZ function from raster package. If input file is a
list of wind data created by wind.dl, a list of raster stacks will be
returned
}
\details{
WGS84 datum (non-projected) CRS is selected by default to build the raster
file.
