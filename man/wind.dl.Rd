\usage{
wind.dl(yyyy, mm, dd, tt, lon1, lon2, lat1, lat2, type = "read-data",
  trace = 1)

read.rWind(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{yyyy}{Selected start year (FROM).}

\item{mm}{Selected start month (FROM).}

\item{dd}{Selected start day (FROM).}

\item{tt}{Selected start time. There are currently several options at the GFS
database: 00:00 - 03:00 - 06:00 - 09:00 - 12:00 - 15:00 - 18:00 - 21:00
(UTC) (FROM).}

\item{lon1}{Western longitude}

\item{lon2}{Eastern longitude}

\item{lat1}{Southern latitude}

\item{lat2}{Northern latitude}

\item{type}{Output type. "read-data" is selected by default, creating an R
object. If you choose "csv", wind.dl create a a CSV file in your work
directory named "wind_yyyy_mm_dd_tt.csv".}

\item{trace}{if trace = 1 (by default) track downloaded files}

\item{file}{file name of one of the saved ".csv" files.}
}
\value{
"rWind list" class object (a list of data.frames) or .csv file/s with
U and V vector  components and wind direction and speed for each coordenate
in the study area defined by lon1/lon2 and lat1/lat2.
}
\description{
wind.dl downloads wind data from the Global Forecast System (GFS) of the
USA's National Weather Service (NWS)
(https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs).
Wind data are taken from NOAA/NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) Atmospheric
Model colection. Geospatial resolution is 0.5 degrees (approximately 50 km),
and wind is calculated for Earth surface, at 10 m. More metadata
information:
http://oos.soest.hawaii.edu/erddap/info/NCEP_Global_Best/index.html
}
\details{
The output type is determined by type="csv" or type="read-data". If
type="csv" is selected, the function creates a "wind_yyyy_mm_dd_tt.csv" file
that is downloaded at the work directory. If type="read-data" is selected,
an R object (data.frame) is created.
}
\note{
wind.dl requires two dates that represent the boundaries of the time
lapse to download wind series data.
U and V vector components allow you to create wind averages or tendences
for each coordenate at the study area. Longitude coordenates are
provided by GFS dataset in 0/360 notation and transformed internaly into
-180/180.
